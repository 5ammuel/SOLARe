# SOLARé
## Project Description
My  app is called SOLARé. It is an information display based app for people with a desire to monitor the amount of sunlight they can expect on a given day. The app allows users to view such data, as well as view, edit, and add comments to the recorded data. In the future, I would like to add user authentication, a feature that would only allow  a specific user to view, edit, or comments on their own data.

### MVP User Stories
_**MVP User Stories**_
- \_As a user, I want to see the weather forecast for the week so I can estimate sun exposure.
- \_As a user, I would like to be able to view, edit, and comment on my data so I can further personalize my data.
- \_As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate between data for the week, single days, and past data, so I can be better informed of possible weather patterns affecting sun exposure.
_**Post MVP Stretch Goals**_
- \_As a user, I would like to be able to have user authentication so my data is only accessible to myself.
- \_As a user, I would like to be able to access this app on the appstore for use with my mobile device.
