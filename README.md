# SOLARé
## Project Description
My  app is called SOLARé. It is an information display based app for people with a desire to monitor the amount of sunlight they can expect on a given day. The app allows users to view such data, as well as view, edit, and add comments to the recorded data. In the future, I would like to add user authentication, a feature that would only allow  a specific user to view, edit, or comment on their own data.
